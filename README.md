# hotel-chain-mgmt-system

The aim of this project is to design and build a management system for Wolf Inns, a popular hotel chain, with hotels in various cities across the country which would be used by the management of Wolf Inns. ( The project has been imported from my university github profile)
The project has been developed in Java and jdbc has been used for database connection, and the database is MariaDB. Initially the whole database schema was planned and designed by making the corresponding E/R diagram and then the database was normalized to 3NF. After this, the application was built. To use this, simply navigate to src and then run type on terminal: javac Application.java and then java Application. (Considering that sql file has been imported properly in mariadb)
